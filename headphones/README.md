Headphones Webpage Project

A fully responsive, accessibility-friendly webpage built from scratch using only HTML & CSS recreating the exact UI from a Figma design.
This project is a pixel-perfect implementation of a landing page for a fictional headphones brand, based solely on a Figma design provided for the ALX Front-End curriculum.
No frameworks, no JavaScript — just pure HTML + CSS mastery.

The goal was to transform the UI design into a fully functional webpage while maintaining:

 Accurate layout & typography
 Responsive design behavior
 Accessibility best practices
 Mobile-first adaptation at ≤ 480px
 I dentical visuals to the designer's file
Original UI designed by Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX Designer).

 Figma Frames: (Insert link to the Figma you duplicated)
 Alternative Access: (Add backup link provided in brief, if you have one)
